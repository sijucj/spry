The compliance explorer covers a wide range of standards and guidelines across different areas of cybersecurity and data protection. They include industry-specific standards, privacy regulations, and cybersecurity frameworks. Complying with these frameworks supports a strong cybersecurity stance and alignment with data protection laws.

The content in this folder is authored as a markdown-driven SQLPage page (`README.md`) and the site is configured to use a local SQLite database (`sqlpage.db`).

## Layout

```sql LAYOUT
-- global LAYOUT (defaults to **/*)



SELECT 'shell' AS component,
       'Compliance Explorer' AS title,
       NULL AS icon,
       'https://www.surveilr.com/assets/brand/content-assembler.ico' AS favicon,
       'https://www.surveilr.com/assets/brand/compliance-explorer.png' AS image,
       'fluid' AS layout,
       true AS fixed_top_menu,
       'index.sql' AS link,
       '{"link":"./index.sql","title":"Home"}' AS menu_item;

SET resource_json = sqlpage.read_file_as_text('spry.d/auto/resource/${ctx.path}.auto.json');
SET page_title  = json_extract($resource_json, '$.route.caption');

```

## Files

- `README.md` — the page source (markdown + SQL/JSON/JS/etc..) that defines the site content and cards.
- `ingest/` — CSV files and supporting data to import into the local `sqlpage.db` (not all files listed here).

The below SQL code first sets a variable (resource_json) from the JSON file and extracts the page caption. Then it adds an introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the compliance explorer. Finally, it renders a responsive card layout (2 columns) listing key cybersecurity and data protection standards — such as CMMC, AICPA, HiTRUST, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and THSA — each with structured markdown descriptions (geography, source, version, and review date).

  Create tailored policies directly for <b>Control Code: ' || $id || '</b> &mdash; <b>FII ID: ' || fii_id || '</b>.
  The "Policy Generator Prompt" lets you transform abstract requirements into actionable, 
  written policies. Simply provide the relevant control or framework element, and the prompt
  will guide you in producing a policy that aligns with best practices, regulatory standards, 
  and organizational needs. This makes policy creation faster, consistent, and accessible—even

      Ensure your policies stay effective and compliant with the "Policy Audit Prompt". These prompts are designed to help users critically evaluate existing policies against standards, frameworks, and internal expectations. By running an audit prompt, you can identify gaps, inconsistencies, or outdated language, and quickly adjust policies to remain audit-ready and regulator-approved. This gives your team a reliable tool for continuous policy improvement and compliance assurance.

## Quick start

1. Ingest CSV files (recursively) and transform them into the SQLPage database (`sqlpage.db`):
   
   ```bash
   surveilr ingest files --csv-transform-auto -r ingest -d sqlpage.db
   ```

2. Build the SQLPage notebook page from `README.md` and pipe into the database:
  
   ```bash
   ../../lib/sqlpage/codebook.ts --md README.md --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | sqlite3 sqlpage.db
   ```

3. Start the SQLPage server:

   - Windows: `sqlpage.exe`
   - Linux (from repository root): `SQLPAGE_SITE_PREFIX="" sqlpage.bin`
   - macOS (Homebrew): `sqlpage`

4. Open your browser at the configured port (default in `README.md` example: `http://localhost:9221`).

### Notes
- This folder assumes you have the SQLPage tooling from the repository (see `lib/sqlpage`).
- [`surveilr`](https://www.surveilr.com/) is used to ingest CSV files — ensure it is installed or available in your PATH.
- Commands above assume a Unix-like shell; Windows paths/commands differ slightly.
- The top of this `README.md` contains a YAML front-matter example used by SQLPage:
  - siteName: Sets the site name as Cpation-Explorer.
  - database_url: Points to the SQLite database (sqlpage.db) in read-write-create mode.
  - web_root: Defines the web root directory for serving files (./)
  - allow_exec: Enables execution of scripts/SQLPage commands.
  - port: Configures the web server to run on port 9221.
  - Adjust the `database_url` and `port` as needed.

## Development: auto rebuild & restart

During active development it's convenient to automatically rebuild the packaged page and restart the `sqlpage.bin` server when markdown changes. The following example uses `watchexec` to watch `.md` files, rebuild the notebook with the repository `codebook` tool, write the output into `sqlpage.db`, and restart the local `sqlpage.bin` server:

```sh
watchexec -e md -- bash -c 'pkill -f sqlpage.bin || true; deno run -A ../../lib/sqlpage/codebook.ts --md README.md --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | sqlite3 sqlpage.db; sleep 1; SQLPAGE_SITE_PREFIX="" sqlpage.bin &'
```

### Notes:

- This command assumes `watchexec`, `deno`, and `sqlite3` are installed and available in your PATH.
   - Install `watchexec` from: https://webinstall.dev/watchexec/
- The `pkill` call attempts to stop any running `sqlpage.bin` process before starting a fresh instance. On systems without `pkill`, stop the server manually.
- The one-second `sleep` gives SQLite a moment to flush the write before the server restarts.

## Troubleshooting

- If the server won't start, confirm `sqlpage` binary exists and is executable. On Linux you may need to run `chmod +x sqlpage.bin` from repo root.
- If pages fail to render, check the `sqlpage.db` file for schema.
