# Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you work effectively with Spry.

## Spryfile

The Spryfile is the heart of your Spry configuration. It can be either:

- `Spryfile` - A plain configuration file
- `Spryfile.md` - A Markdown file with embedded configuration

## Cells and Pseudo Cells

### Regular Cells

Regular cells are the actual data cells in your spreadsheet files. Spry reads and processes these cells according to your configuration.

### Pseudo Cells

Pseudo cells are virtual cells generated by Spry for advanced processing scenarios. They allow you to:

- Create computed values
- Generate metadata
- Add processing context

## Binary Content

Spry supports binary content in spreadsheets, allowing you to:

- Embed files within cells
- Process binary data
- Extract embedded content

## Processing Pipeline

Spry processes files through a pipeline:

1. **Read**: Load the spreadsheet file
2. **Parse**: Extract cell data and structure
3. **Transform**: Apply your processing rules
4. **Output**: Generate the result in your desired format

## Content Acquisition

Spry uses a robust content acquisition system to:

- Fetch remote content
- Handle various file formats
- Cache data efficiently

## Configuration

Configuration can be done through:

- Spryfile
- Command-line arguments
- Programmatic API
