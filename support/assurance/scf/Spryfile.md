# Secure Controls Framework (SCF) SQLPage Application

This script automates the conversion of the latest Secure Controls Framework
(SCF) Excel workbook from the
[official SCF GitHub repository](https://github.com/securecontrolsframework/securecontrolsframework)
into a structured SQLite database.

- Uses Spry to manage tasks and generate the SQLPage presentation layer.
- Uses DuckDB with its built-in `excel` and `sqlite` extensions.

## Setup

Download the SCF Excel workbook from the GitHub repo and place it into the same
directory as this `README.md` and then run `spry.ts task prepare-db`. We supply
our own `#!/usr/bin/env -S bash` shebang since we have comments in the shell
script.

```bash prepare-db --descr "Delete and recreate the SQLite database used by SQLPage"
#!/usr/bin/env -S bash
rm -f scf-2025.3.sqlite.db                  # will be re-created by DuckDB `ATTACH`
cat prepare.duckdb.sql | duckdb ":memory:"  # DuckDB processes in memory but creates SQLite DB
```

## SQLPage Dev / Watch mode

While you're developing Spry's `dev-src.auto` generator should be used:

```bash prepare-sqlpage-dev --descr "Generate the dev-src.auto directory to work in SQLPage dev mode"
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json
```

```bash clean --descr "Clean up the project directory's generated artifacts"
rm -rf dev-src.auto
```

In development mode, here’s the `--watch` convenience you can use so that
whenever you update `Spryfile.md` it regenerates the SQLPage `dev-src.auto`
which then is picked up automatically by SQLPage server:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json --watch --with-sqlpage
```

- `--watch` turns on watching all `--md` files passed in (defaults to
  `Spryfile.md`)
- `--with-sqlpage` starts and stops SQLPage after each build

Restarting SQLPage after each re-generation of dev-src.auto is **not** necessary
so you can also use `--watch` without `--with-sqlpage` in one terminal window
while keeping SQLPage running in another terminal window.

If you're running SQLPage in another terminal window, use:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json --watch
```

## SQLPage single database deployment mode

After development is complete, the `dev-src.auto` can be removed and
single-database deployment can be used:

```bash deploy --descr "Generate sqlpage_files table upsert SQL and push them to SQLite"
rm -rf dev-src.auto
./spry.ts spc --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | sqlite3 scf-2025.3.sqlite.db
```

## Layout

This cell instructs Spry to automatically inject the SQL `PARTIAL` into all
SQLPage content cells. The name `global-layout.sql` is not significant (it's
required by Spry but just used for reference) but the `--inject **/*` argument
is how matching occurs. The `--BEGIN` and `--END` comments are not required by
Spry but makes it easier to trace where _partial_ injections are occurring.

```sql PARTIAL global-layout.sql --inject **/*
-- BEGIN: PARTIAL global-layout.sql
SELECT 'shell' AS component,
       'Secure Controls Framework (SCF) Explorer' AS title,
       NULL AS icon,
       'https://www.surveilr.com/assets/brand/content-assembler.ico' AS favicon,
       'https://www.surveilr.com/assets/brand/compliance-explorer.png' AS image,
       'fluid' AS layout,
       true AS fixed_top_menu,

       '{"link":"/index.sql","title":"Home"}' AS menu_item;

SET resource_json = sqlpage.read_file_as_text('spry.d/auto/resource/${path}.auto.json');
SET page_title  = json_extract($resource_json, '$.route.caption');
-- END: PARTIAL global-layout.sql
-- this is the `${cell.info}` cell on line ${cell.startLine}
```

## SCF Home Page

Index page which automatically generates links to all `/scf` pages.
`navigation_node` is automatically generated by Spry.

```sql index.sql { route: { caption: "Home" } }
SET routes_json = sqlpage.read_file_as_text('spry.d/auto/route/forest.auto.json');
SET root_path   = '/scf';

SELECT 'card' AS component, '' AS title, 2 AS columns;
SELECT
  IFNULL(json_extract(c.value,'$.payloads[0].caption'),
         json_extract(c.value,'$.basename'))                         AS title,
  json_extract(c.value,'$.payloads[0].description')                  AS description_md,
  json_extract(c.value,'$.path')                                     AS link
FROM json_each(
       json_extract(
         (SELECT jt.value
          FROM json_tree(json($routes_json)) AS jt
          WHERE jt.type='object'
            AND json_extract(jt.value,'$.path') = $root_path
          LIMIT 1),
         '$.children'
