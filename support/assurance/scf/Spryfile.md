# Secure Controls Framework (SCF) SQLPage Application

This script automates the conversion of the latest Secure Controls Framework
(SCF) Excel workbook from the
[official SCF GitHub repository](https://github.com/securecontrolsframework/securecontrolsframework)
into a structured SQLite database.

- Uses Spry to manage tasks and generate the SQLPage presentation layer.
- Uses DuckDB with its built-in `excel` and `sqlite` extensions.

## Setup

Download the SCF Excel workbook from the GitHub repo and place it into the same
directory as this `README.md` and then run `spry.ts task prepare-db`. We supply
our own `#!/usr/bin/env -S bash` shebang since we have comments in the shell
script.

```bash prepare-db --descr "Delete and recreate the SQLite database used by SQLPage"
#!/usr/bin/env -S bash
rm -f scf-2025.3.sqlite.db                  # will be re-created by DuckDB `ATTACH`
cat prepare.duckdb.sql | duckdb ":memory:"  # DuckDB processes in memory but creates SQLite DB
```

## Environment variables and .envrc

This project reads configuration from environment variables. Two variables you will commonly set in development are:

- `SPRY_DB` — the database connection URL used by SQLPage and Spry. Example value used here:
  `sqlite://scf-2025.3.sqlite.db?mode=rwc`
  - Scheme: `sqlite://` followed by a path (relative or absolute) to the SQLite file.
  - Query `mode=rwc` tells SQLite/DuckDB to open the file for read/write and create it if missing.
  - If you prefer a path under a `data/` directory, set e.g. `sqlite://./data/scf-2025.3.sqlite.db?mode=rwc`.

- `PORT` — the TCP port the local SQLPage server or other local web component should listen on (example: `9227`).

Recommended practice is to keep these values in a local, directory-scoped environment file. If you use direnv (recommended), create a file named `.envrc` in this directory.

POSIX-style example (bash/zsh):

```sh
# .envrc (bash/zsh)
export SPRY_DB="sqlite://scf-2025.3.sqlite.db?mode=rwc"
export PORT=9227
```

Then run `direnv allow` in this project directory to load the `.envrc` into your shell environment. direnv will evaluate `.envrc` only after you explicitly allow it.

## Security and repository hygiene

- Never commit secrets or production credentials into `.envrc`. Treat `.envrc` like a local-only file.
- Add `.envrc` to your local `.gitignore` if you keep secrets there. Alternatively commit a `.envrc.example` or `.envrc.sample` with safe, non-secret defaults to document expected variables.
- The SQLite file (e.g. `scf-2025.3.sqlite.db`) is a binary database file — you will usually not check this into version control. Add that filename or the `data/` directory to `.gitignore` as well.

Why these variables matter here

- The YAML header at the top of this `Spryfile.md` reads `database_url: ${env.SPRY_DB}` and `port: ${env.PORT}` — Spry and the SQLPage tooling will substitute those environment values when building or serving the site.
- If `SPRY_DB` is not set, the tooling may fail to find the database or fall back to defaults; explicitly setting it ensures predictable, repeatable dev runs.

Quick troubleshooting

- If the server does not start on the expected port, verify `echo $PORT` (or `echo $SPRY_DB`) in your shell to confirm values are loaded.
- If direnv appears not to load `.envrc`, re-run `direnv allow` and ensure your shell config contains the direnv hook.


## SQLPage Dev / Watch mode

While you're developing, Spry's `dev-src.auto` generator should be used:

```bash prepare-sqlpage-dev --descr "Generate the dev-src.auto directory to work in SQLPage dev mode"
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json
```

```bash clean --descr "Clean up the project directory's generated artifacts"
rm -rf dev-src.auto
```

In development mode, here’s the `--watch` convenience you can use so that
whenever you update `Spryfile.md`, it regenerates the SQLPage `dev-src.auto`,
which is then picked up automatically by the SQLPage server:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json --watch --with-sqlpage
```

- `--watch` turns on watching all `--md` files passed in (defaults to
  `Spryfile.md`)
- `--with-sqlpage` starts and stops SQLPage after each build

Restarting SQLPage after each re-generation of dev-src.auto is **not**
necessary, so you can also use `--watch` without `--with-sqlpage` in one
terminal window while keeping the SQLPage server running in another terminal
window.

If you're running SQLPage in another terminal window, use:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json --watch
```

## SQLPage single database deployment mode

After development is complete, the `dev-src.auto` can be removed and
single-database deployment can be used:

```bash deploy --descr "Generate sqlpage_files table upsert SQL and push them to SQLite"
rm -rf dev-src.auto
./spry.ts spc --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | sqlite3 scf-2025.3.sqlite.db
```

## Raw SQL

This raw SQL will be placed into HEAD/TAIL.

```sql TAIL --import ../../../lib/universal/schema-info.dml.sqlite.sql
-- this will be replaced by the content of schema-info.dml.sqlite.sql
```

This raw SQL will be placed into HEAD/TAIL. Include as a duplicate of the above
show style-difference between `sql TAIL --import` and `import` which creates
pseudo-cells.

```import --base ../../../lib/universal
sql *.sql TAIL
```

## Layout

This cell instructs Spry to automatically inject the SQL `PARTIAL` into all
SQLPage content cells. The name `global-layout.sql` is not significant (it's
required by Spry but only used for reference), but the `--inject **/*` argument
is how matching occurs. The `--BEGIN` and `--END` comments are not required by
Spry but make it easier to trace where _partial_ injections are occurring.

```sql PARTIAL global-layout.sql --inject **/*
-- BEGIN: PARTIAL global-layout.sql
SELECT 'shell' AS component,
       'Secure Controls Framework (SCF) Explorer' AS title,
       NULL AS icon,
       '/assets/brand/content-assembler.ico' AS favicon,
       '/assets/brand/compliance-explorer.png' AS image,
       'fluid' AS layout,
       true AS fixed_top_menu,
       'index.sql' AS link,
       '{"link":"/index.sql","title":"Home"}' AS menu_item;

SET resource_json = sqlpage.read_file_as_text('spry.d/auto/resource/${path}.auto.json');
SET page_title  = json_extract($resource_json, '$.route.caption');
SET page_path = json_extract($resource_json, '$.route.path');

${ctx.breadcrumbsSQL("'/' || $page_path","$page_title")}

-- END: PARTIAL global-layout.sql
-- this is the `${cell.info}` cell on line ${cell.startLine}
```

Get the brand assets and store them into the SQLPage content stream. They will
be stored as `assets/brand/*` because the `--base` is
`https://www.surveilr.com/`. The `--spc` reminds Spry to include it as part of
the SQLPage content since by default utf8 and other file types don't get
inserted into the stream.

```import --base https://www.surveilr.com/
utf8 https://www.surveilr.com/assets/brand/content-assembler.ico --spc
utf8 https://www.surveilr.com/assets/brand/compliance-explorer.png --spc
```

## SCF Home Page

Index page which automatically generates links to all `/scf` pages.

```sql index.sql { route: { caption: "Home" } }
SET routes_json = sqlpage.read_file_as_text('spry.d/auto/route/forest.auto.json');
SET root_path   = '/scf';

SELECT 'card' AS component, '' AS title, 2 AS columns;
SELECT
  IFNULL(json_extract(c.value,'$.payloads[0].caption'),
         json_extract(c.value,'$.basename'))                         AS title,
  json_extract(c.value,'$.payloads[0].description')                  AS description_md,
  json_extract(c.value,'$.path')                                     AS link
FROM json_each(
       json_extract(
         (SELECT jt.value
          FROM json_tree(json($routes_json)) AS jt
          WHERE jt.type='object'
            AND json_extract(jt.value,'$.path') = $root_path
          LIMIT 1),
